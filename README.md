# vim-play-framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomd/vim-play-framework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thomd/vim-play-framework)

This is going to be a vim plugin for [play framework 1.x](https://github.com/playframework/play1) mainly for syntax highlighting and code snippets.

This is work in progress - use it for your own risk.

## Test

To run Rspec tests you need MacVim installed:

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake
