# vim-play-framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomd/vim-play-framework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thomd/vim-play-framework)

This is going to be a vim plugin for [play framework 1.x](https://github.com/playframework/play1) mainly for syntax highlighting and code snippets.

This is work in progress! It actually does only one trivial thing up to now: handle tag files as html.

## Test

Apart from not having much benefit, this plugin contains a test based on [rspec](http://rspec.info/) and [vimrunner](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/vimrunner).

To run tests you need MacVim installed:

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake
